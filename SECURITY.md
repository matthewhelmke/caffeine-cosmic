## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, please report it following these steps:

1. **Direct Contact:** Send an email to **[oussama.berchi@gmail.com]** with the subject "Security Vulnerability - caffeine-cosmic".
2. **Details:** Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact.
3. **Response Time:** I am a solo maintainer, but I will do my best to acknowledge your report within 48–72 hours.
4. **Disclosure:** Once a fix is ready, I will coordinate with you to publish a security advisory and credit your contribution.

## Responsible Disclosure

I ask that you follow responsible disclosure principles:
- Give me reasonable time to fix the issue before making it public.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for any purpose.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure for the COSMIC community!
