# Caffeine for COSMIC

A native Rust applet for the COSMIC Desktop Environment that prevents your system from going to sleep. Perfect for presentations, watching videos, or any time you need your screen to stay awake.

## What Does It Do?

When activated, Caffeine prevents your computer from:
- Turning off the display
- Going to sleep or suspend mode
- Activating the screensaver

The applet sits in your panel and shows a coffee cup icon. Click it to toggle caffeine mode on or off.

The install script uses Rust's `cargo` tool to build the Caffeine applet binary, then install it and other artifacts into appropriate locations and update desktop databases for the applet to be found by the system and work.

Once installed, you will find the applet in COSMIC Settings ready to be installed into your panel or dock.

1. In COSMIC Settings, open `Desktop > Panel > Configure panel applets` or `Desktop > Dock > Configure dock applets`.
1. Use `Add applet` to find Caffeine.
1. Click `Add` to add the applet.
1. (optional) Use the handle at the left of the Caffeine entry to move it to your desired location within the panel or dock.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **COSMIC Desktop Environment** - This applet only works on COSMIC (Pop!_OS 24.04+)
2. **Rust** - Latest stable version ([install from rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
3. **just** - Command runner ([install instructions](https://github.com/casey/just#installation))
4. **Build dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libssl-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev pkg-config
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### The applet doesn't appear in the panel options

- Make sure you've logged out and back in after installation
- Try running `just run` from the terminal to see if there are any errors
- Check that you're running COSMIC Desktop (not GNOME or another DE)

### The icon doesn't show up correctly

- Run: `sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f -t /usr/share/icons/hicolor`
- Log out and back in

### Caffeine doesn't prevent sleep

- Make sure you're running on COSMIC Desktop
- The applet uses the XDG Desktop Portal for inhibiting sleep
- Check if the portal is running: `systemctl --user status xdg-desktop-portal`

### Error messages in terminal

Run with debug logging to see detailed information:
```bash
just run-debug
```

## How It Works

Caffeine uses the **XDG Desktop Portal** (specifically the Inhibit portal) to request that the system not enter idle state. This is the standard, secure way to prevent sleep on modern Linux desktops.

The applet communicates via **D-Bus** to:
1. Register an "inhibit" request with the desktop portal
2. Sync state across multiple instances of the applet
3. Automatically release the inhibit when stopped or when timer expires
